	Add socket timeouts to the soft debugger.

	SDB now support setting a send/receive timeout on the client's
	side of the communication socket. To make this work, the server
	sends a special 'keepalive' event when using receive timeouts.

	There's a new method VirtualMachine.SetSocketTimeouts() to enable
	this feature.

2011-01-21  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@gmail.com>

	Obsolete VirtualMachine.GetNextEvent () as it is impossible to
	determine when to resume after an event, since the debuggee
	suspends only once per event-set.

	Add a TID field to ThreadMirror which returns the system thread
	id.

	Fixi soft debugger dll crash on Windows w/redirected console

	Windows socket behaviour seems to be slightly different from
	Linux/Mac, and Mono.Debugger.Soft was trying to disconnect a
	socket that that doesn't get connected, causing an exception at
	launch.

	For some reason it did check the main debugger socket before
	trying to disconnect it, but not the console socket, so only apps
	with redirected console output would crash.

2010-12-13  Michael Hutchinson  <mhutchinson@novell.com>

	Remove default arg usage from sdb dll so it can be compiled with
	csc 3.5

	* IProcess.cs:
	* VirtualMachine.cs:
	* VirtualMachineManager.cs:
	Added new IProcess interface which wraps the debugged process.

	booleans which specify whenever to report caught/uncaught exceptions.

	* StructMirror.cs (this): Ignore static fields.

2009-12-02  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>
