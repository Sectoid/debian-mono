	state check for short-circuiting.

	Fix ReaderWriterLockSlim unit tests.

	In the latest revision of the framework, ReaderWriterLockSlim is
	totally fair and thus a call to TryEnterReadLock musn't succeed
	when writers are waiting to get the lock before them (and when the
	lock is currently in read mode).

	Fix ReaderWriterLockSlim unit tests.

	As stated by MSDN, to be fully downgraded to a read lock state a
	call to ExitUpgradableReadLock must be issued straight after
	EnterReadLock.
