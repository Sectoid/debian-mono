	HTTP authentication in HttpListener had dropped during
	refactoring. Now it's back.

	[wcf] AJAX GET requests work now.

	HttpListenerManagerTable always looked up HttpListerManager
	instances using the full URI while it should have disregarded the
	/operation?parameters part of the request in order to match the
	service endpoint's base address.

	[wcf] make /js and /jsdebug dispatchers work.

	There were several issues here:

	- The IChannelDispatcherBoundListener was defined twice, in two
	different namespaces, and it caused code in
	ChannelDispatcher.Attach not to set its associated listener's
	ChannelDispatcher property to the correct value. This, in turn,
	caused incorrect HttpListenerManagerTable operation, where it
	would put the "/js" and "/jsdebug" dispatchers in separate
	HttpListenerManagers, instead of in the main (base) service's one.
	- After fixing the above, it turned out that SvcHttpHandler
	selected the manager based on the host's base address, when it
	should first try to find one whose URL matches the current request
	exactly.

	[wcf] Don't close HTTP response prematurely.

	Service is invoked in the context of the System.Web pipeline and
	closing the response before the final output stream flush causes
	the generated response not to ever reach the client. This patch
	makes sure the System.Web pipeline takes care of all the response
	housekeeping.

	Remove extra call to HttpResponse.Flush() which would crash.

2010-09-24  Atsushi Eno  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	Filter requests only by paths, excluding host and port.

2010-08-30  Atsushi Eno  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	Add not-working code for TransferMode support.

2010-08-24  Atsushi Eno  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	Disable separate loop for HttpListener context acquisition. It
	prevents HttpStandaloneChannelListener from closing itself.

2010-08-20  Atsushi Eno  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	When closing the listeners, TryDequeueRequest() could be somehow
	invoked after the listener entry was removed, so expect null
	search result.

2010-07-14  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* HttpReplyChannel.cs : pass HTTP ContentType header value to
	  MessageEncoder.ReadMessage().

2010-07-08  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequestContext.cs : remove extra Action handling and old comment.

2010-07-05  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequestContext.cs, HttpChannelListener.cs, HttpReplyChannel.cs:
	  rename unnecessary "Standalone" (removed).

2010-07-05  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* HttpStandaloneReplyChannel.cs
	  HttpStandaloneRequestContext.cs
	  HttpStandaloneChannelListener.cs
	  HttpReplyChannel.cs
	  HttpRequestContext.cs
	  HttpChannelListener.cs : renamed former 3 files to latter 3 files.

2010-07-05  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* HttpStandaloneReplyChannel.cs, HttpChannelListenerEntry.cs,
	  HttpContextInfo.cs, HttpListenerManager.cs,
	  HttpStandaloneRequestContext.cs, HttpListenerManagerTable.cs:
	  Fixed wsdl support in the new codebase, so enabled it again, and
	  made significant changes for ASP.NET integration. Now ASP.NET
	  implementation switched to the new one.

2010-07-05  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* HttpStandaloneReplyChannel.cs
	  HttpContextInfo.cs
	  HttpListenerManager.cs
	  HttpStandaloneRequestContext.cs
	  HttpListenerManagerTable.cs : revert previous changes, regression
	  on wsdl support.

2010-07-02  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* HttpStandaloneReplyChannel.cs, HttpStandaloneRequestContext.cs:
	  add more code that the asp.net stuff will become like.

2010-07-02  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* HttpStandaloneReplyChannel.cs, HttpListenerManager.cs,
	  HttpStandaloneRequestContext.cs :
	  refactoring, to add ASP.NET implementation. (not in use yet)

2010-07-02  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* HttpContextInfo.cs, HttpListenerManager.cs,
	  HttpListenerManagerTable.cs : add implementation for ASP.NET, not
	  in use yet.

2010-06-24  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* HttpListenerManager.cs : finish pending wait handle when closing
	  a listener. Fixed the issue on closing host/listener/channels.

2010-06-24  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* HttpStandaloneReplyChannel.cs : do not try to enter close loop
	  between request context and this.

2010-06-23  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* HttpStandaloneChannelListener.cs
	  HttpStandaloneReplyChannel.cs
	  HttpStandaloneRequestContext.cs
	  HttpListenerManagerTable.cs
	  HttpChannelListenerEntry.cs
	  HttpContextInfo.cs
	  HttpListenerManager.cs :
	  Refresh implementation for HTTP channel listener in new namespace,
	  which works fine with throttling.

	  It still has some issue in closing channels or listeners, so it
	  does not replace existing implementation yet.
