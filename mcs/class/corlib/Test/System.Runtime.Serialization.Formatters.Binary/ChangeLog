	[corlib] Prevent BinaryFormatter to throw on missing fields

	This commit includes unit tests that were run in MS.NET > 2.0. The
	old behaviour of MS.NET 1.1 is still included in the patch as an
	ONLY_1_1 define, to be backport-friendly to other branches (but
	can be removed from now on in next commits, as mono master doesn't
	include this profile anymore). Fixes BNC#324144.
