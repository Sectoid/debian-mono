	Move the predicate call under launched.TrySet protection in Task's
	ContinueWithCore

	Sometimes the predicate was also called multiple time generating
	exception that weren't caught by the general Task handler and thus
	swallowed by the runtime causing Thread shutdown and ultimately
	deadlocks.

	Change the way continuation delegates are stored and processed in
	Task. Fix random the random hangs.

	Use Interlocked.Read (long) call directly in CyclicDeque.

	Since the call is also implemented as a simple long load operation
	in the runtime when on x86-64 there is no need to do the
	differentiation in managed code.

	Fix cancellation tracking and reporting in Task.

	Avoid waiting in an endless loop in ThreadWorker.

	In some rare case where a ThreadWorker have taken more than one
	item (and thus there are items to steal) another ThreadWorker that
	hadn't seen this extra work would go to sleep indefinitely and
	cause deadlock if the first Task executed was depending on another
	Task to be launched.

	Move NET_4_0 define checks at the right position under the licence
	text

	Use kernel-event in ThreadWorker and Scheduler to sync new arrival
	of work to do.

	Instead of shutting down the thread when there is no more work to
	do, each ThreadWorker will now block on an EventWaitHandler and be
	awoken later by Scheduler.
