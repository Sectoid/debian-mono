	Ensure that Task is in a correct initial state before starting it
	for real

2011-07-27  Jérémie Laval  <jeremie.laval@gmail.com>

	Allow using a worker number that is greater than
	Environment.ProcessorCount for parallel loops.

2011-03-21  Jérémie Laval  <jeremie.laval@gmail.com>

	Revert fcbb5717c18ff8393f2300a254bb13e6fab9c7e4 and implement it
	differently.

	The commit had the good idea but since some values of the
	enumeration overlap it broke the correct behavior. Instead we now
	turn off the extra options and use the previous way to check.

2011-03-18  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnome.org>

	Merged compile fix from master

2011-03-18  Rafael Munitic  <rafael.munitic@gmail.com>

	Must pass null to overloaded constructor instead of wrapper lambda
	(TaskCompletionSource can use overloaded constructors and it will
	pass null in function argument)

2011-03-18  Rafael Munitic  <rafael.munitic@gmail.com>

	Continuation options should be checked as flags

2011-03-18  Rafael Munitic  <rafael.munitic@gmail.com>

	If the function is null Wait will not get called and will not
	check if Future is in faulted state/raise the exception

2011-03-16  Koushik Dutta  <koushd@gmail.com>

	Fix bug where if a task is Start-ed with a specific scheduler,
	that scheduler is ignored if it is in a thread owned by another
	scheduler. Tasks should not be locked to the scheduler that owns
	the calling thread.

	Fix bug where TryExecuteTask does not actually try to execute the
	task. Instead, TryExecuteTaskInline is called, which is abstract.
	The TpScheduler implementation, the default, then calls the
	internal method Task.Execute which then actually executes the
	task. The problem with this is that only 3rd party schedulers,
	can't actually execute a task, thus making extending TaskScheduler
	impossible. (Unless they use some serious Mono specific reflection
	hacks as I am now.)

2011-03-13  Jérémie Laval  <jeremie.laval@gmail.com>

	Don't throw an exception when task array is empty in WaitAll and
	throw in case a null element is encountered in it.

2010-11-03  Jérémie Laval  <jeremie.laval@gmail.com>

	Refactor Task.Wait and Task.WaitAny methods and add support for
	scheduler-less waiting.

	A scheduler-less waiting is useful for instance in case Tasks are
	waited upon without having being started (like in some
	continuation chaining case).

2010-11-03  Jérémie Laval  <jeremie.laval@gmail.com>

	Set more state on TaskCompletionSource inner Task<T>

2010-11-02  Jérémie Laval  <jeremie.laval@gmail.com>

	Use Task helper methods in TaskCompletionSource instead of manual
	setting, allow continuation flow to happen smoothly and task
	status to be set accordingly.

2010-08-27  Jérémie Laval  <jeremie.laval@gmail.com>

	Move the predicate call under launched.TrySet protection in Task's
	ContinueWithCore

	Sometimes the predicate was also called multiple time generating
	exception that weren't caught by the general Task handler and thus
	swallowed by the runtime causing Thread shutdown and ultimately
	deadlocks.

2010-08-27  Jérémie Laval  <jeremie.laval@gmail.com>

	Change the way continuation delegates are stored and processed in
	Task. Fix random the random hangs.

2010-08-24  Jérémie Laval  <jeremie.laval@gmail.com>

	Use Interlocked.Read (long) call directly in CyclicDeque.

	Since the call is also implemented as a simple long load operation
	in the runtime when on x86-64 there is no need to do the
	differentiation in managed code.

2010-08-18  Jérémie Laval  <jeremie.laval@gmail.com>

	Fix cancellation tracking and reporting in Task.

2010-08-17  Jérémie Laval  <jeremie.laval@gmail.com>

	Avoid waiting in an endless loop in ThreadWorker.

	In some rare case where a ThreadWorker have taken more than one
	item (and thus there are items to steal) another ThreadWorker that
	hadn't seen this extra work would go to sleep indefinitely and
	cause deadlock if the first Task executed was depending on another
	Task to be launched.

2010-08-13  Jérémie Laval  <jeremie.laval@gmail.com>

	Move NET_4_0 define checks at the right position under the licence
	text

2010-08-03  Jérémie Laval  <jeremie.laval@gmail.com>

	Use kernel-event in ThreadWorker and Scheduler to sync new arrival
	of work to do.

	Instead of shutting down the thread when there is no more work to
	do, each ThreadWorker will now block on an EventWaitHandler and be
	awoken later by Scheduler.
