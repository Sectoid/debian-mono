Description: Mono runtime
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Novell.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 This package contains the Virtual Machine, JIT (Just-in-Time) and
 AOT (Ahead-of-Time) code generator "mono".
 "mono" executes applications for the CLI (Common Language Infrastructure).
 Mono currently only supports the X86, PowerPC, ARM, SPARC, S/390, AMD64 and
 IA64 architectures. Optionally this package configures BINFMT support.

 This package uses SGen which is Mono's new simple generational garbage collector
 instead of Boehm's conservative garbage collector. SGen is currently only
 for testing and thus should not be used in production.
