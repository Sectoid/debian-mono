Description: Mono runtime
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Novell.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 This package contains the Virtual Machine, JIT (Just-in-Time) and
 AOT (Ahead-of-Time) code generator "mono".
 "mono" executes applications for the CLI (Common Language Infrastructure).
 Mono currently only supports the X86, PowerPC, ARM, SPARC, S/390, AMD64 and
 IA64 architectures. Optionally this package configures BINFMT support.

 This package uses SGen which is Mono's new simple generational garbage
 collector instead of Boehm's conservative garbage collector. SGen is
 currently only for testing and thus should not be used in production.

Description: Mono WCF libraries (for CLI 2.0)
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Novell.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 This package contains the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) libraries
 of Mono for CLI 2.0. The WFC stack is for building SOA-based applications.
 Its development is in early stages.
 .
 WCF is also used in Moonlight, but it cuts down huge parts of .NET 3.0
 features but this implementation used by Moonlight should be almost feature
 complete.

Description: Mono C# 2.0 and C# 3.0 compiler for CLI 2.0
 This is the Mono C# (C-Sharp) 2.0 and C# 3.0 compiler, a platform-independent
 compiler which produces CIL (Common Intermediate Language) binary executables.
 The gmcs compiler supports two different featuresets (C# versions).
 .
 With C# 2.0 (which is the default) it supports:
  - generics
  - iterators (yield)
  - nullable value types
  - partial types
  - anonymous methods
  - static classes
  - coalesce operator: ??
 .
 With C# 3.0 it supports:
  - Language Integrated Query (LINQ)
  - object initializers
  - collection initializers
  - anonymous types
  - local variable type inference
  - implicitly-typed arrays
  - lambda expressions
  - automatic properties
  - extension methods
  - partial methods
 .
 This compiler targets the CLI 2.0 runtime version.
